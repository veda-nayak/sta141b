# Question 1

## Number of teams in the database
I assumed that since we are looking at team information, I would need to look in the "Teams" table. I first looked at the columns in the table. 

```{r}
dbListFields(db, "Teams")
```


## Number of teams in 2022List the names of the teams for 2022, 
*Include team name, league and division, total number of games, # of games they won and lost*
*Group the results by league, division and games won*


Put the question again in the report, explain what you're doing with the query
